## Why Recommender systems?
When it comes to supporting people in their lives, an optimal recommendation is necessary.

No matter whether you want to introduce people to your social network, recommend a suitable addition to the shopping basket of your customers or need a recommendation for a movie to watch in the evening, there are endless possibilities to apply recommendation engines/systems around us.

This notebook explores and compares the following algorithms and approaches for recommending movies.

* Cosine User-User Similarity
* Autoencoders (AutoRec)
* Matrix Factorization
* Deep Neural Network Learning with Keras
* Residual Learning


## Netflix Prize dataset
I am using the Netflix Prize dataset and the movies-dataset. The movie rating files contain over 100 million ratings from 480 thousand randomly-chosen, anonymous Netflix customers over 17 thousand movie titles.  The data were collected between October, 1998 and December, 2005 and reflect the distribution of all ratings received during this period.  The ratings are on a
scale from 1 to 5 (integral) stars.
